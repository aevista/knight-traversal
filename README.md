<h1> Knight traversal</h1>
This is a little project that I had worked on as apart of the Odin project. The idea is to create an algorithm based off of the binary search tree to find the shortest path for a knight to traverse a board in order to get to that desired position. The algorithm uses the initial position, which then generates all of the potential moves relative to its current location, and checks whether or not that potential position matches the desired position. Each potential move is then pushed into a queue, and then relocates the knight to the first dequeued position. This algorithm continues until the desired position is found.
